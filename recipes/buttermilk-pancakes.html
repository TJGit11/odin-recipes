        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flower</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons bakign soda</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>        
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk dry. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and pinch of salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk wet. Whisk together buttermilk, egg, and melted butter or cooking oil in a 2-cup measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Combine. Pour buttermilk mixture slowly into the flour mixture, stirring to combine as you pour. Allow to rest for at least 5 minutes for the fluffiest buttermilk pancakes.</li>
            <li>Heat. Heat griddle or skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter to griddle or skillet to make sure well coated.</li>
            <li>Cook. Scoop batter onto prepared griddle or skillet by about ⅓ cup. Allow to cook until the edges have lost their sheen and bubbles have formed in the center of the top of the pancake, about 2-3 minutes. Flip the pancake and allow to cook about 2-3 minutes on the other side.</li>
            <li>Serve. Remove from griddle or skillet and serve warm or place on a rimmed sheet pan in a 200º F oven to keep warm for serving.</li>
